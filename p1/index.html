      I started out this project with handpose recognition – 
      getting ml5 working with a basic hand recognition example. <br>
      This involved finding key points, triangulating, and figuring
      out how to pin point the palm. My process dots are shown in yellow:

      I then looked at recognizing other objects. I played around with
      Teachable Machine, which would only classify whole images without
      image segmentation, so that wasn't going to work. I tested out the
      COCOSSD object detector, which had incredibly unreliable results –
      inconsistency of detection and classification, as well as wonky
      coordinates that sometimes showed up outside of the object itself:

      I finally decided to stick with the hands, using perlin noise for
      a tomato squish that oozes down the screen. Please play around with
      it below:
